## Indicators of Heavy Traffic on I-94 Interstate Highway
In this Project analyzed a dataset about the westbound traffic on the Interstate 94 highway (I-94), and the aim is to find a few indicators of heavy traffic on the highway.

At the end of the analysis, I managed to find two types of indicators:

**Time indicators**
- The traffic is usually heavier during warm months (March–October) compared to cold months (November–February).
- The traffic is usually heavier on business days compared to the weekends.
- On business days, the rush hours are around 7 and 16. <br>
  
**Weather indicators**

- Shower snow
- Light rain and snow
- Proximity thunderstorm with drizzle
